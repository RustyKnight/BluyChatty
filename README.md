# BluyChatty
A simple test bed for testing BLE functionality through the use of a peer-to-peer style chat program.
The App is not intended to be a "fully fledged" chat App, so it won't store messages, but is intended to be a BLE test bed for testing the CoreBluetooth API.
The App also provides a place to for testing UI flow, on boarding concepts and messaging concepts
